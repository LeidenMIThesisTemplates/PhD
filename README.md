# PhD

Here you can find a template for writing your PhD thesis in latex, hopefully according to the style requirement of Leiden University (disclaimer: you shoudl check for youself that it actually fulfills the requirements!). There may be more than one template here in future, but for now we have a version kindly created by Stefan van der Lugt. 

You can just make a copy of the template and use it (use 'code > download zip'), or pull from github if you know how to do that. IF you come up with improvements (or want to add a different template) you can make a pull request; and probably email David Holmes when you do so, to be sure he notices this.
